## ðŸ’¼ Current Projects
  **LLM Use Cases in Political Science**  
  Exploring applications of large language models for measuring ideology and predicting vote choice.  

  **Spatial Machine Learning**  
  Leveraging spatial data and machine learning techniques to map and predict the geographical distribution of political preferences.  

  **Experimental Approaches to Democracy**  
  Investigating the tradeoff between democratic support and institutional safeguards (e.g. party bans).
