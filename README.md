## Hi there 👋

I'm a political scientist/quantitative researcher/data analyst.

## 💼 Current Projects
  **LLM Use Cases in Political Science**  
  Exploring applications of large language models for measuring ideology, ranking policies, and predicting vote choice.  

  **Spatial Machine Learning**  
  Leveraging spatial data and machine learning techniques to map and predict the geographical distribution of political preferences.  

  **Experimental Approaches to Democracy**  
  Investigating the tradeoff between democratic support and institutional safeguards (e.g. party bans).

## 📊 Skills (with examples) 
 **Causal inference**
 - Regression discontinuity designs ([see here](https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140221139375) or [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055420000945))
 - Instrumental variable approaches ([see here](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123423000297))
 - Other natural experiments ([see here](https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2021.1992482))
 
 **Spatial econometrics**  
 - The design of electoral districts ([see here](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/723975))
 - Interfederal cooperation, competition, and redistribution ([see here](https://doi.org/10.1086/703132))
 - Geographical sorting and the emergence of political actors ([here](https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaa014))

 **Machine Learning and LLMs**
 - Using LLMs to measure the ideology of heads of government ([see here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389130765_Fine-Tuning_Ideology_Leveraging_Large_Language_Models_to_Measure_the_Ideology_of_Heads_of_Government_Around_the_World_1870-2020/stats))
 - LLMs vs supervised machine learning for electoral predictions (in progress) 
 - Using spatial machine learning to map pre-industrial regime preferences (in progress)
